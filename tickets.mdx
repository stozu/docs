# How to contact support?
Trust me, it's easy.

## 1: via Discord (preferred)
To contact us using Discord, join our server, and go on the ticket channel ([click here to open it](https://discord.com/channels/1030919416680038460/1046855982145355846)).
Then, select the category of your issue, and your ticket will be made.
Finally, go in your newmade ticket chat, and explain your issue in a full sentence. 

<Warning>Please, respect theses rules when making tickets. You might get warned if you don't respect them.

Don't ping staff multiple times. We already get pinged when you make the ticket.
Don't expect us to be here 24/7. We have a life, and we might stop responding for a bit. We'll come back to it later.
And last, don't make a ticket to not talk in it and expect us to guess your issue.</Warning>

<Tip>Tickets might be disabled for x reason temporairly. Please, don't spam us of pings. We will be aware of it.</Tip>

## 2: via Panel (worst)
We don't recommand this way, as we will most likely not respond on it frequently.
To start, go on your dashboard, and click on Support Tickets. Then, click create ticket, fill in all the forms, and send it.
We'll take a look at it soon, and we should get back to you soon.

<Note>Don't make multiple tickets for the same reason, as it will make our matter worse.</Note>
