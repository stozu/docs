# Let's see how to make backups.
## 1: Make a manual backup
<Info>You have 3 backup slots on Stozu. If you have 3/3 backups, delete one to make another.</Info>

To get started, go on the panel page of Stozu, click on your server, and then on the right menubar, click on Backups.
Then, click on the little + to create a backup right now. You can name it, add directories or files that won't be backed up (/folder/file.ext), and even lock the backup to prevent deletion.

Your backup will then create, it can **take some time** depending of the size of your server, and it should finish without any issues!

## 2: Automate backups
