<Note>This guide presumes you are currently using a computer, running Windows, macOS, or Linux. You can also do the same on a mobile device, tho it is harder, and this guide will not cover it.</Note>

# Okay, now, we're going to see how to manage your server's files.
It's not hard, tho you'll need some patience and time.
First, you need to establish which file transfer protocol you want to use.

There's two file transfer protocols on Stozu:
1. SFTP (Shell File Transfer Protocol): Will allow you to copy-paste files very easily from your computer, and manage them on your server. You'll need a computer for it, as it's hard to do it on phone.
2. Panel: You can send files directly to your server using the built in files tab in your server's panel. Note that it'll be a bit slower and might not always work for big files (> ~100MB), but it has a built in file editor.

## 1: SFTP
<Info>In this tutorial, we're going to use the SFTP Client "FileZilla". We use it as it's one of the most known and easiest for first-hand users. However, nothing stops you from installing another one, and using it. You can download FileZilla for free [here](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client).</Info>

First, install FileZilla for your current OS (it's compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows).
Then, open the app. It's going to show a welcome prompt, you can close it.
Then, click at the top on the little server icon (see image) 
<img src="/images/filezilla.png" alt="Filezilla opened on the top left" />
Then, click on the bottom on "New Site". Give it a friendly name, like Stozu SFTP or anything you want. Then, on the right, change "FTP" to "SFTP".
On your panel of your server, click on Settings on the right hand menubar, then copy the username, and server address.
Back to FileZilla, for host, put the server address (without sftp://, and :2022), and for the port put 2022.
for the Username, put the username on the settings page, and for the password, put your Stozu's password.
After that's done, you're ready to rock! Hit the Connect button, and you should see on the right side of fileZilla your server's files.
Now, you can copy paste, import files, and do anything you would want to do.

**If you have any issues or questions using SFTP, don't hesitate to ask on Discord. We'll be happy to help!**

## 2: Panel
<Info>This will be the way you would want to do it if you're on mobile, chromeOS, or you can't install apps for x reason.</Info>

Okay, so this will be easier than SFTP. Go on your server's panel page, and click on Files from the right hand menubar.
On that page, you'll be able to drag'n-drop files, create files/folders, upload files, or even edit files via the builtin text editor.
With that said, it is quite limited as files above 100 MB will have a bit of issues such as non being able to upload, or edit.
