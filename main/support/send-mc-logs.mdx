# We will learn how to get access to your logs, and share them.
<Info>A "log" is basically a server history which allows us to diagnose and see what happened on your server. Logs might contain personnal information such as tokens or usernames. Please, check your logs before sending them.</Info>

## 1: How to access your logs
This is quite easy, if your server crashes, just send us basically what happened in the console before the server crashed till the end of the crash log. (copy-pasting will work).
You're not required to send the ENTIRETY of your server's logs, even tho we don't mind it.

If your crash was before and you already restarted your server, you might be able to access a "log file" in the root of your server files or under a "logs" directory. If you don't have it, you will need to provide us logs so we can diagnose further.

<Check>That's it!</Check>

## 2: Sending your logs to support
<Warning>Do not send us your logs by copy-pasting the entirety of the log directly on Discord or via a "message.txt". It will be bulky and hard to read, and make our job harder. So please, do that for us!</Warning>

For this part, you can use two recommended websites: MCLogs, or Pastebin, which two are very reputated websites for sharing logs. They are both secure.
Once you're on thoses sites, paste your log, and click save or create new paste. (depends on the tool you use).
Then, it'll redirect you on the link of your shared log. Just copy-paste this link to us in the support conversation, and we'll be able to diagnose further.

<Check>Done! (please, also: don't ping us in the ticket, we might take time to look at it).</Check>
