# Let's go over common issues that can happen on your server.
Please note that this is not a exhaustive list, and if you don't see your issue here, please contact support ([click here to learn more](/tickets)).

## 1: My server refuses to start! (any reason)
Simply send us your error logs and open a ticket. We'll look further into it. Also, please send your server ID (the small ptero-type one) while you're at it, so we can also check the startup arguments.

## 2: Out of memory!!!!
Check if you have too much plugins, too much mods, or that your server is being overloaded for any reasons. It can also mean you don't have enough RAM, or too many players are in your server that your server can handle. If you think all thoses reasons aren't the cause, you can still open a ticket.

## 3: Connection refused: no further information (Client)
This error happens when your client can't communicate with the server properly.
This is most likely a network issue on your side, check if you can access other servers, or even go online. You should also check if your ISP is blocking certain websites (proxy). If they are, please contact them.
Also note that your school's/organization's proxy might block our host server. We can't do anything about it, they set up the restriction. (get back to work)

On a more serious note however, if you're sure it's not a you issue, you should check your server logs. Maybe they are saying something about an error for a broken plugin, mod, or even a reason to why you can't connect.

<Warning>If you are playing cracked, check if online mode is OFF. (server.properties)</Warning>

If everything seems fine, you should just contact us and send us your logs (the appropriate way). We'll look into it.

## 4: Server experiencing a **crazy** amount of latency
This could be caused by two things;

### 1: Your own Internet
Maybe your Internet is currently terribly slow, or you are very far away from the gameserver you are currently trying to connect to.
To check your own net's latency, use something like Speedtest.net or FAST.
You should also ask the owner of the server where is the server located. If it's very far from your location, this could be a reason.

### 2: Stozu's own issue (stroke)
It could also be that too many servers are online right now, which could lag everyone's servers, and in the end make everyone have a bad laggy experience. (and a bad day)
If that's the case, it should all be back to good once it's no longer rush hour.

## 5: (x) plugin/mod is causing server crashes!!!
If you recently modified the plugin/mod's configuration, revert back to the last known working configuration.
However, if you didn't modify it recently, it might also be that it's not up to date.
You should update it.

<Note>We don't provide support for broken plugins/mods. If you can't find a fix, please contact the maker of this plugin/mod.</Note>
